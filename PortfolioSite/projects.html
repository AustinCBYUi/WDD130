                <p>DayZ XML Editor was my first console-based project released to the public.
                    It was made to 'automate' the process of editing xml files for administrators
                    of servers and opened to the modding community. The program modifys values in roughly
                    over 20,000 lines to precision. The program still features a roadmap with plans to be 
                    a full suite of tools for server owners in the future!

                <p>Service Journal was a project I started to keep track of my customer base
                    with mechanic work. I got tired of trying to remember everything, so I decided to
                    develop this application to streamline the process. It is object oriented, and currently writes
                    customer information to a text file with a random UID. It will have a search
                    function in the future and the ability to send invoices to customers! This
                    project uses tkinter.

            <p>
                The Chemistry Mole Calculator was written as a school assignment I had during my freshman
                year at Brigham Young University Idaho. Originally the expectations were to just print to the console with the correct
                math and logic. We are given the opportunity to utilize the 'stretch challenge' to get full credit
                for an assignment in which we must add creativity. I had been working a lot with Tkinter at the time
                so I decided to write the project with a GUI! I figured maybe the application will come in handy at a later
                date, so I put it on my github as well!
