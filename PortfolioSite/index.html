                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a multi-purpose developer and aspiring web / software developer.
                    I was raised in Arizona, I've been exposed to technology since I was around
                    7 years old. I played a lot of games growing up, and expressed my creativity
                    by creating, fixing or contributing to things. I am currently a freshman
                    pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science at Brigham Young University
                    Idaho, majoring in Software Engineering.
                <br><br><br>
                    On my free time I enjoy hiking, expanding my knowledge by reading or watching
                    videos / movies, working on personal projects in both technology and physical
                    things, fixing / building cars or off road vehicles, and shooting guns!

                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I have developed a plethora of soft skills overtime. I have an extremely focused
                    work ethic, always striving to learn new things or challenge myself physically and
                    mentally, undying desire to develop the future of technology.
                    <br><br><br>
                    I am well spoken, can
                    contribute profoundly to a team, attention to detail, leadership, operating under
                    pressure, and following directions promptly and effectively. I am confident in my
                    abilities to communicate and accomplish singular or common goals within my work place
                    or personal life.
