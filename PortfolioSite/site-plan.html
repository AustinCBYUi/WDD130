      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Purpose is to create a suitable portfolio for my
        future, and hopefully to land a job. It will include
        projects I've built along with experience in tools / Languages
        I've picked up.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will primarily target future employers, 
        however I created a logo for my site and decided to name it
        Austin Freelance (May change at a later time to Austin Consulting)

      <p>
        Soft skills and personal info:
        I really enjoy doing projects on my own for fun and contributing to a team or group of people.
        I’ve contributed to groups of 
        developers, web designers, game developers, game modification creators (like the Steam Community), 
        and even close friends who may need something specific. I genuinely enjoy writing code that people 
        can understand and use for themselves, or applications they can use- while additionally creating 
        something from an idea in my head is absolutely astounding to me.
        <br>
        customer service, respect of others, caring for others and the project / job at hand, relentless in getting the job done correctly, not cutting corners, 
        listening and performing orders efficiently, and correctly. Maybe some other non-relatable skills or hobbies I have to show employers I am a healthy and 
        well-rounded individual. I can rebuild motors or work on just about any car, I’ve always been about trying to fix things myself 
        before paying others to do it. I’ve had laziness before, but no longer is that even a part of my blood. I take major pride in my ability to work all 
        day in the AZ Sun and 100+ degree weather, come home and head straight to the gym, then head back home to either 
        get a start on my school work or dinner for my wife and kid. Even so, during that list of activities I manage to squeeze in things like house-cleaning, 
        car cleaning / detailing, oil changes, yard work, pest control sprays, fixing things around the house etc..

      </ul>
      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        My experience page will have: I expect my website will answer if I am a good fit to either be employed or to perform work on a project for someone as a 
        freelance developer. My website will include my specialized programming languages and tools I use frequently such as photoshop, 
        AI, VSCode etc.. The projects section will include personal projects I developed or websites I developed on my free time to showcase 
        my efficiency in what I do as well as my desire to create projects in the first place.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        My projects page will showcase projects I have developed (major projects that have usage in real world applications / websites I’ve made) and want to show others. 
        I hope that people can appreciate the attention to detail I put in my code, the commenting and thoughtfulness I express to walk not only my future self through the 
        thought-process but also others who may be viewing it and wondering why I did something a specific way. Additionally I hope the unique 
        ideas or simple ideas I express in the form of projects can stand out to employers/clients. I don’t want to make another web scraper, or 
        Netflix clone. I want to make software that helps ME in my daily life, or helps me with my other ‘projects’ I’ve tried to start like my business 
        Straight 6 Performance, or better yet a software that is potentially groundbreaking in mental health to help people connect with others anonymously 
        for addiction recovery or the sort. I visualize my success being a servant of God to help others with whatever I can.
