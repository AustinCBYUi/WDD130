    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2><i>Austin Campbell</i></h2>
    <p>I currently work full time as a lead termite technician for Orkin Pest Control, 
        I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science to hopefully be a software engineer in the future.
        I plan to transition into the tech field in August or September. The main thing I am enjoying about BYU-Idaho
        so far is the online learning and 'self-pacing'. I am married and I have a 2 year old step son.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, driving, shooting, reading, studying and learning miscellaneous things
        outside of school and work. Anything outside or even inside I can find joy in doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope to meet all of you soon. Thanks!
