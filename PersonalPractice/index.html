            <h2>Specialties</h2>
            <p>
                Specializing in small and medium sized homes with modern
                appliances, foundation and building design. We will never sell
                a home without a proper inspection for foundation cracks,
                termite infestations, dry rot, or the lader. See our 'Inspection'
                page for more details!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="box2">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                Our developments and home purchases with flips increase on an
                average percentage of 300% in price! That's three times the price
                we purchase homes at! Our brokerage services can help lock in a
                decent and workable price and GUARANTEE a 150% return!
